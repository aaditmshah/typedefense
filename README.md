The ratio of the number of resistances and immunities to the number of weaknesses for each pokémon type and type combination. Read the following [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TruePokemon/comments/4zz3zv/ratio_of_resistances_and_immunities_to_weaknesses/) for more information.

# Design #

The design of the pokémon type chart was copied from [pokemondb.net](http://pokemondb.net/type). Unfortunately, according to the author I'm [not allowed to copy](http://pokemondb.net/about) his design. If he'd let me use his design or if somebody would help me redesign the type chart then I'd greatly appreciate it.

The license only extends to the JavaScript code because the design of the type chart belongs to [pokemondb.net](http://pokemondb.net/type).
